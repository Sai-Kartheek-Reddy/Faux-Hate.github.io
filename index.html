        <h1>Welcome to the <a href="https://www.au-kbc.org/icon2024/" target="_blank">ICON 2024</a> shared task on <em>Decoding Fake Narratives in Spreading Hateful Stories (Faux-Hate)</em></h1>
    </header>

    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Social media has revolutionized the way we communicate, but it has also opened the door for the rapid spread of harmful content, including hate speech. Hate speech on social platforms not only affects individuals and communities but can also escalate into violence and societal harm. In recent years, there has been a growing concern about the intersection of <strong>hate speech</strong> and <strong>fake narratives</strong>, which has prompted the need for specialized methods to detect and curb their spread.</p>
        <h3>What is Faux-Hate?</h3>
        <p>Briefly, Faux-Hate is the generation of <strong>hate speech</strong> driven by <strong>fake narratives</strong>. This task focuses on identifying comments that blend fake information with hateful language to mislead and provoke individuals, exacerbating the impact of hate speech. The goal of this shared task is to explore how fake narratives can contribute to the propagation of hate and to develop models that can detect such instances within code-mixed Hindi-English social media text.</p>

        <h2>Task Overview</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Faux-Hate</strong> shared task is designed to challenge participants to tackle both <strong>fake</strong> and <strong>hate</strong> detection in social media comments, with additional emphasis on identifying the <strong>target</strong> and <strong>severity</strong> of hateful speech.</p>

        <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fake</strong>: Misinformation deliberately spread with the intention to mislead.</li>
            <li><strong>Hate</strong>: Speech intended to marginalize individuals or groups based on attributes like religion, ethnicity, or political beliefs.</li>
            <li><strong>Target</strong>: The intended subject of the hate speech, classified as either an individual, organization, or religion.</li>
            <li><strong>Severity</strong>: The intensity of the hate speech, ranging from low (disagreement) to high (advocating violence).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sub-tasks:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Binary Faux-Hate Detection</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fake</strong>: Whether the content is fake (1) or real (0).</li>
                    <li><strong>Hate</strong>: Whether the content is hate speech (1) or not (0).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Target and Severity Prediction</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Target</strong>: The subject of the hate (Individual (I), Organization (O), or Religion (R)).</li>
                    <li><strong>Severity</strong>: The degree of hate (Low (L), Medium (M), or High (H)).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
